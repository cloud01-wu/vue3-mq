# v3.0.0: The Reimagining

Vue 3 MQ was initially a fork of [Alexandre Bonaventure's](https://alexandrebonaventure.github.io/vue-mq) Vue MQ project with a few coding changes to help it to work with Vue 3 complete with a couple of extra features sprinkled on top.

Version 3 is a complete reimagining of the plugin. The code has been re-written from the group up to ensure it takes full advantage of the power of Vue 3 and offers a simple, yet powerful way to respond to vast number of environments your application has to operate in.

See our [v2-3 migration guide for full details](/migration/from-version-2.md), but key changes are:

- Global objects and components have been dropped in favour of imports/injections. This helps your app's size and performance by reducing overhead where it's not needed.
- Support for detecting orientation ( landscape / portrait ) and theme ( dark / light)
- The helper is now and the mq prop has become target.
- mq is no longer a responsive value, but a full-blown reactive object. Quickly react to breakpoints, orientation and theme with a wide range of boolean values. Rendering on a mobile could be as simple as `if (mq.mdMinus) { ... }`
- Choose from common presets (Bootstrap, Vuetify, Tailwind) to quickly get Vue3 MQ up and running with your UI of choice.
- Full support for both Options API and Composition API builds of Vue3.
