# v2.3.0 Breakpoint slots for the `MqLayout` component 

In addition to the mq="sm" property on the component, you can now also use breakpoint slots which can combine with Transition Groups for more powerful and complex renderings.

```vue
<mq-layout group>
    <template #sm>For small screens only</template>
    <template #md-xl>For medium to extra-large screens only</template>
    <template #sm:2>Another slot for small screens only</template>
    <template #lg->For large and smaller screens</template>
</mq-layout>
```
